# BadParkers
An iOS app that shames bad parkers.

Spot a blindfolded parking attempt? With BadParkers you can now share their results quickly and easily! This app uploads the image of their attempt to a map for other users to scorn and facepalm over. It also has a comment section
so users can rate, share, and civilly discuss each attempt.

BadParkers uses Cloud Firestore to store the geolocation and comments of each image and Firebase Storage to store the images themselves.

This app was created to demonstrate some of the things I learned and to experience creating an entire app.
